# excitation_automaton

A discrete automaton inspired by <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0029">this article</a> about signal propagation in rings of mushrooms(!). The researchers modeled the behavior as a network of locally-connected nodes which become active above a certain threshold of active neighbors and then enter a cooldown phase:

This model allows the propagation of easily-recognizable "waves" of excitation:
